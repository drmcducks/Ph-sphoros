# Ph≈çsphoros
(Work In Progress) News website with vintage interface inspired by old newspaper.

<h2>Why Ph≈çsphoros? ü§î</h2>
Ph≈çsphoros is a romanized Greek word for "light-bringer," another name for the planet Venus's appearance before the sunrise.
Some people also call this appearance of planet Venus "Morning Star," and its corresponding Latin word is Lucifer.
A light can also symbolize hope, wisdom, and knowledge, thus I hope that the site can "bring light" to the people who use it.
